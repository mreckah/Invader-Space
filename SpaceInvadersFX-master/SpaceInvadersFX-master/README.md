# SpaceInvadersFX
This is an implementation of the classic arcade game of Space Invaders done entirely in Java usring the JavaFX platform. Like the original,
given a limited amount of lives, the player must try to clear away the space invaders by shooting at them.

In this simple application, the user must click the left and right arrows to move, and the up arrow to shoot, while avoiding being shot
at by the invaders.
